# Sample Project

This is a sample project demonstrating Git branching, merging, and conflict resolution.


### **1. Created a Feature Branch**
- Created a branch named `feature-branch` from `master`.
- Added a new `<div>` section in `index.html`.
- Merged `feature-branch` into `master` after completing the changes.

### **2. Introduced Conflicting Changes**
- Made changes in both `master` and `feature-branch` separately.
- Attempted to merge `feature-branch` into `master`, which resulted in a **merge conflict**.

### **3. Resolved Merge Conflict**
- Manually resolved the merge conflict in `index.html`.
- Created a merge commit to finalize the merge.
